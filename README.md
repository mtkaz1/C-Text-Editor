# A C Text Editor!

This is a text editor created in C for personal use, which was inspired by the "Build your own text editor" tutorial which will be referenced, but with some personal changes for my own use.



## Usage

**Clone the Repository, Change the Directory, and Run**

git clone https://github.com/mtkaz1/C-Text-Editor.git
cd C-Text-Editor
make kilo
./kilo

## Goal

To deepen my understanding of low-level programming, as well as the usage of a multitude of C libraries, especially termios, ANSI Escape Sequences, and Raw I/O terminal actions.
